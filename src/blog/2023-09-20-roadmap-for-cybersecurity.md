So, you want to get into cybersecurity?
First you have to develop "**Hacker Mindset**". *A hacker mindset is a highly curious mind like a child. Constantly wondering how things work. What will happen if I do this or that. Trying to break things to understand the inner workings.*  
# Fundamental 
You are not a student of computer science and have little to no knowledge about computers then you should do Harvard University's [CS50: Introduction to Computer Science](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science) course.

After completing CS50, go for [Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/google-certificates/cybersecurity-certificate). It is an 8-course series certification program by Google that will clear all the fundamental concepts of cybersecurity with hands-on exercise. 

After that do [Cybersecurity for Students](https://app.letsdefend.io/path/cybersecurity-for-students) learning path by Letsdefend. It is a good resource to have an overview of fundamental concepts of cybersecurity like networking, windows, linux, cryptography, malware analysis and job hunting.

After doing following three course you will have a strong foundation on computer, network and security:
- [CompTIA 220-1001 and 220-1002 A+ Course](https://www.professormesser.com/professor-messer-archives/220-1001/220-1000-training-course/) by Professor Messer
- [CompTIA N10-008 Network+ Course](https://www.professormesser.com/network-plus/n10-008/n10-008-video/n10-008-training-course/) by Professor Messer
- [CompTIA SY0-601 Security+ Course](https://www.professormesser.com/security-plus/sy0-601/sy0-601-video/sy0-601-comptia-security-plus-course/) by Professor Messer


Now we need to understand the how things works a little deeper before proceed any further. So for that you need to do and practice the following course if you can (not free):
- [Fundamentals of Network Engineering](https://www.udemy.com/course/fundamentals-of-networking-for-effective-backend-design/)
- [Fundamentals of Database Engineering](https://www.udemy.com/course/database-engines-crash-course/)
- [Fundamentals of Backend Engineering](https://www.udemy.com/course/fundamentals-of-backend-communications-and-protocols/)


OK. So you have an idea what cybersecurity is. Now watch [this video](https://youtu.be/tUmSOnaqWBo) subscribe all the youtube channels mentioned bellow:

Now let's refresh some concepts again:

- **Linux**: Watch and practice [Linux Essentials for Ethical Hackers](https://youtu.be/1hvVcEhcbLM) by Freecodecamp.
- **Python**: Watch and practice [Python for Hackers](https://youtu.be/0fC1JsN8AsM) course by PhD Security.
- **SQL**: Watch and practice [SQL Injection](https://youtu.be/2nXOxLpeu80) course by Freecodecamp.
## Certification
If you have done [Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/google-certificates/cybersecurity-certificate). So *you can skip both certificate below*:

- [Certified in Cybersecurity](https://www.isc2.org/certifications/cc) by ISC2 is a beginner level certification which certifies your foundational knowledge, skills and abilities for an entry or junior level cybersecurity role. Also, till now it is FREE.
- [Comptia Security+](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/security) is also a beginner level certification which validates the baseline skills necessary to perform core security functions and pursue an IT security career. You need to spend [$219 USD](https://emerging-store.comptia.org/Certification-Vouchers/c/11330?facetValueFilter=tenant~certification%3acomptia-security%2ctenant~user-type%3aindividual) (in Bangladesh) to do the exam.
